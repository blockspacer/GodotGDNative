For our game, we decided on having an AI that shoots at the player
and another AI that follows the player and stuns the player on 
contact. 

-StunAI: The AI spawns once the player enters the AI's spawn area.
This area is a sphere with radius 10. Within the sphere, the AI
sets the player's current position as its goal, and slowly moves
towards the player. If it successfully touches the player, the
player will be stunned and the AI will despawn. If the player
successfully runs away from the AI and exits the spawn area,
then the AI will despawn. The AI works as expected with the exception
that when the player exits the spawn area, the AI is "disabled" but
the actual instance of the scene doesn't actually go away. If the player
is hit by the AI, however, all the instances currently in the main scene
will disappear. The AI is super simple and only makes decisions based
on whether the player is in the sphere or not. The idea was to put
multiple spawn points that would make the maze in our game more difficult to
navigate.


//November 7th hotfix
ShootingAI: Will patrol between two waypoints. If it sees 
the player, a visible laser sight will appear and it 
will start shooting flaming projectiles. If it hits the 
player their position will be reset.
If the player touches the enemy it will die.

Raycasting and targeting the player was much more difficult than
expected. The raycasting can still break the game if the player moves
from a detected angle to the side of the enemy. The yellow walls should
reduce the chance of this happening.

A finish line was added to end the game.
