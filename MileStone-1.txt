Overall Design
	Platformer like game where you wander around a track and try to get as many
	 points as possible until the playerâ€™s stamina runs out by interacting with
	  the scene. Different types of movement and interactions costs different 
	  amounts of stamina. We will have a character followed around by a 
	  3d camera. Sound effects will happen anytime a point is awarded and 
	  there will be background music present at all times. GUI will display
	   current points and stamina left. Potentially stamina refills if you 
	   collect them.


Software Architecture and Plan
	Kinematic Body class and associated script for player movement and 
	interaction with the scene. Score and stamina can be kept inside this 
	class if necessary. 
	Any type of class and script necessary for other scene objects
	Basic implementation of game will be easy, we will probably spend most of
	 the time setting up the scene to be as interactive and engaging as 
	 possible.


Division of Labor
	Basic Movement already implemented + double jump custom movement
	Since we are all busy we will work together to implement things in the 
	following order
	1. WalkableAngle
	2. Ledge Stop/Ledge Hang
	3. Flying
	4. Object interactions
	5. GUI and Status Display
	6. Sound effects and Background music
	7. More complex Camera controls(semi transparent geometry and mouse input)
	8. Tune physics and collision detection
