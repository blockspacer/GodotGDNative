Our stun AI spawns if the player is within a certain radius. 
From the spawn position, walk forward in a straight line and 
you should see the ai appear when you enter the spawn radius.
StunAI will chase the player. If it touches the player
you will be stunned.

//November 7th hotfix
New shooting AI. Will patrol between two waypoints.
If it sees the player it will stop and start shooting.
If you touch it, you can kill it.

Also I added some flaming particle effects to the 
shootingAI projectiles, if particle effects are desirable
for potential extra credit

A little late, but crossing the finish line at the end will 
result in a game won.
